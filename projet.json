    enum des statuts de r√©ponse USSD
    The USSD network response status codes are part of the standard codes defined in 3GPP TS 27.007, which is the specification for AT commands used in GSM/UMTS/LTE mobile devices. These codes indicate the state of a USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) session or operation.

        This status is returned when the USSD session does not require any more interaction from the user.
        It occurs either when the network initiates a USSD Notify, which is an informational message, or when the mobile-initiated operation completes without needing further input.
        Example useCase : 
        - You query your mobile balance, and the network sends a one-time informational response (e.g., "Your balance is $10").
